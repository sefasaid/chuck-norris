## Why use hash route?

I use github pages to deploy it. And it's limited configuration. (not like nginx or nodejs ect) . That's why I use hash route.

## Github actions

I created github actions for test build and deploy.

## Project structure

I separate pages & components & services.

Also I did use lazy loading in routing and create modules for every.
